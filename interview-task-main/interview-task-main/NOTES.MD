- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
z-score :it gives you an idea of how far the point is from the mean data. 
min-max :performs a linear transformation on the original data.
normaliztion methods :we ues normalization method to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values.
example:
value   z-score    Min-Max
10       0.5718    0
1       -0.59786   0
3       -0.3379    0.22222
5       -0.07798    0.444444
9       0.441897   0.88888889
```

- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?
```
Juint5 is a library used for test Maven and Gardle build system.
unit test is a way of testing unit-smallest pieces of code used to ensure that code meets quality standards before it's developed.
